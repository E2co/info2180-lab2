                <p>October 1, 2024 by Dam Esco</p>
                <p>In this article, I'll share my experience with creating a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On of the most significant lessons I learned was the importance of planning and organizng my code. By structuring my project logically, I found it easier to maintain and troubleshoot.</p>
